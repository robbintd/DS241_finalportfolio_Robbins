First in-class DS241 project; loosely adopted from 'R for Data Science' textbook.

This file has minimal commenting throughout, as it was a preset assortment of tasks to practice basic dplyr verbs and R concepts.

```{r}

library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)
library(here)
library(nycflights13)

# Loading raw (tidied) data
df1 = nycflights13::flights
glimpse(df1)

  
```

Task 1:
```{r}
df2 = df1 |> filter(month == 9, origin == "MIA")
glimpse(df2)

```

Task 2:
```{r}
df3 = df1 |> filter(month == 9, dest == "MIA")
glimpse(df3)
  
```

Task 3:
```{r}
df4 = df1 |> filter(month == 1, dest == "MIA")
glimpse(df4)

```

Task 4:
```{r}
df5 = df1 |> filter(5 < month, month < 10, dest == "MIA")
glimpse(df5)
```


```{r}
